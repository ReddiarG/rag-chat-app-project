THIS PLAN SHALL NOT PREJUDICE THE RIGHTS GRANTED BY APPLICABLE CONSUMER LAW, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE REMEDIES UNDER STATUTORY WARRANTY LAW AND TO SEEK DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF THE NON-PERFORMANCE BY APPLE OF ANY OF ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.</p><p><b>1. The Plan</b></p><p>This contract (the “Plan”) governs the services provided by Apple under the above plan and includes the terms in this document, your Plan Confirmation (“Plan Confirmation”), and the original sales receipt for your Plan. Your Plan Confirmation will be provided to you at the time of purchase or sent to you automatically thereafter. If you purchased your Plan from Apple, you may obtain a copy of your Plan Confirmation by going to <u><a href="http://mysupport.apple.com/products">mysupport.apple.com</a><a href="http://mysupport.apple.com/products">/products</a></u>.</p><p>Benefits under this Plan are additional to your rights under applicable laws, the manufacturer's hardware warranty and any complimentary technical support. The terms of the Plan apply the same whether paid for on a one-time basis (“Single-Pay Plan”) or a monthly basis (“Monthly Pay Plan”) unless otherwise noted.</p><p>The Plan covers the following equipment (collectively, the “Covered Equipment”): (i) the Mac listed on your Plan Confirmation (“Covered Device”), (ii) the Apple-branded accessories contained inside the original packaging of your Covered Device, and (iii) an Apple-branded mouse, Magic Trackpad, and keyboard if included with the Covered Device (or purchased with a Mac mini, Mac Pro or Mac Studio), an Apple memory modules (RAM) and Apple USB SuperDrive (“Mac Accessories”), which are used with a Covered Device and purchased no earlier than two years before the Covered Device.</p><p>This Plan is intended to and does only apply to your Covered Equipment. This Plan is not for your commercial use and may not be used by you in furtherance of any private gain including, but not limited to, seeking service for devices owned by others and which are not covered by this Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, you may not sell, transfer, subcontract, delegate, or assign any of your rights under this Plan. Apple has the right to monitor your service requests to ensure compliance. Violation of this provision may void this Plan.</p><p>Coverage begins when you purchase the Plan and continues, unless cancelled, through the date specified in your Plan Confirmation (the “Plan Term”).</p><p>You can find the price of the Plan on the original sales receipt.</p><p><b>2. What is Covered?</b></p><p><u>2.1 Hardware Services for Defects or Consumed Battery (“Hardware Service”)</u></p><p>If during the Plan Term, you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that a defect in materials and workmanship has arisen in the Covered Equipment or, in relation to Covered Equipment which uses an integrated rechargeable battery, where the capacity of the Covered Device’s battery to hold an electrical charge is less than eighty percent (80%) of its original specifications, Apple will either: (i) repair the defect at no charge, using new parts or previously used genuine Apple parts that have been tested and pass Apple functional requirements, or (ii) exchange the Covered Equipment with a replacement product that is new or comprised of new and/or previously used genuine Apple parts and has been tested and passed Apple functional requirements.</p><p>All replacement products provided under this Plan will at a minimum have the same or substantially similar features (e.g., a different model with the same features, or the same model in a different color) as the original product. If Apple exchanges the Covered Equipment, the original product becomes Apple’s property and the replacement product is your property, with coverage effective for the remainder of the Plan Term.</p><p><u>2.2 Services for Accidental Damage from Handling (“ADH Service”)</u></p><p>If during the Plan Term you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that the Covered Device has failed due to accidental damage from handling resulting from an unexpected and unintentional external event (such as, drops and damage caused by liquid contact) (“ADH”), Apple will either (i) repair the defect using new parts or previously used genuine Apple parts that have been tested and pass Apple functional requirements, or (ii) exchange the Covered Device with a replacement product that is new or comprised of new and/or previously used genuine Apple parts and has been tested and passed Apple functional requirements. <b>Exclusions apply as described below. </b></p><p>Each time you receive services for ADH is a “Service Event”.</p><p><b>Each Covered Device is eligible for up to two (2) Service Events every twelve (12)-month period from the date of your Plan purchase as specified on the original sales receipt. Any unused Service Events will expire and you will get two (2) new ADH Service Events to use within the next twelve (12)-month period of continued coverage. All other Plan benefits continue throughout.</b></p><p><u>2.3 Technical Support</u></p><p>During the Plan Term, Apple will provide you with priority access to telephone and web-based technical support for Covered Equipment (“Technical Support”). Your Technical Support starts on expiration of the complimentary technical support provided by Apple, which starts on the date you purchase the Covered Equipment. Technical support may include assistance with installation, launch, configuration, troubleshooting, and recovery (excluding data recovery), including storing, retrieving, and managing files; interpreting system error messages; and determining when hardware service is required or ADH coverage may be applicable. Apple will provide support for the then-current version of the supported software, and the prior Major Release. For purposes of this section, the term “Major Release” means a significant version of software that is commercially released by Apple in a release number format such as ”1.0” or “2.0” and which is not in beta or pre-release form.</p><p>Apple Technical Support is limited to the following: (i) the Covered Equipment, (ii) the Apple-branded Operating System (“OS”) and Apple-branded software applications that are pre-installed on or designed to operate with the Covered Equipment (“Consumer Software”), and (iii) connectivity issues between the Covered Equipment and a laptop or desktop computer that meets the Covered Equipment’s connectivity specifications and runs an operating system supported by the Covered Equipment. <b>Exclusions apply as described below.</b></p><p><b>3.

How to Obtain Service and Support?</b></p><p>You may obtain service or Technical Support by calling Apple at 800-800-2775 or accessing <u><a href="https://support.apple.com/">support.apple.com</a></u>. You must provide the Plan Agreement Number or Covered Device serial number. You must also, upon request, present your Plan Confirmation, and the original sales receipt for your Covered Device and your Plan.</p><p><b>5. Service Options</b></p><p>Apple will provide hardware services to you through one or more of these options:</p><p>(a) Carry-in service. Carry-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. Return the Covered Equipment to an Apple-owned retail store location or to an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”) that offers carry-in service. Service will be performed for you at the store, or the store may send the Covered Equipment to an Apple repair service (“ARS”) site for service. You must promptly retrieve the Covered Equipment.</p><p>(b) Onsite service. Onsite service is available for many Mac desktop computers if the location of the Covered Equipment is within 50 miles (80 kilometers) radius of an Apple Authorized Onsite Service Provider. Certain parts serviceable under do-it-yourself parts service, as described below, are not eligible for Onsite service. If Apple determines that onsite service is available, Apple will dispatch a service technician to the location of the Covered Equipment. Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(c) Onsite service is available for certain other Covered Devices, depending on availability in your service location. Verify eligibility and schedule a service appointment with an Apple authorized mobile service provider at&nbsp;<u><a href="http://support.apple.com/country-selector">support.apple.com/country-selector</a></u>. If onsite service is available at your desired location, you will be contacted directly by Apple’s authorized service provider to confirm your appointment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will&nbsp;transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple&nbsp;will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(d) Mail-in service. Direct mail-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. If Apple determines that your Covered Equipment is eligible for mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills (and, if needed, packaging material). You must ship the Covered Equipment to an ARS site in accordance with Apple’s instructions. Once service is complete, the ARS site will return the Covered Equipment to you. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if you follow all instructions.</p><p>(e) Express Replacement Service (“ERS”) or do-it-yourself (“DIY”) parts service. ERS is available for certain Covered Equipment. DIY parts service is available for many Covered Equipment. This allows you to service your own Covered Equipment. If Apple requires return of the replaced device or part, Apple may require a credit card authorization to serve as security for the retail price of the replacement device or part and applicable shipping costs until you return the replaced device as instructed. If you are not able to provide credit card authorization, service may not be available to you in which case Apple will offer an alternative arrangement for service. If you fail to return the replaced Covered Equipment or part as instructed or return a replaced Covered Equipment or part that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge the credit card for the authorized amount. If Apple does not require return of the replaced product or part, Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement product or part accompanied by any applicable instructions or requirements for disposal of the replaced product or part. Apple is not responsible for any labor costs you incur in respect to ERS or DIY parts service.</p><p>ERS is not available for Mac.</p><p>Apple may change the method by which Apple provides repair or replacement service to you, and your Covered Equipment's eligibility to receive a particular method of service.</p><p>Service will be limited to the options available in the country where you request service. Service options, parts availability and response times may vary. If service is not available for the Covered Equipment in a country that is not the country of purchase, you may be responsible for shipping and handling charges to facilitate service in a country where service is available. If you seek service in a country that is not the country of purchase, you must comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. For international service, Apple may repair or exchange products and parts with comparable products and parts that comply with local standards.</p><p><b>6.

THIS PLAN SHALL NOT PREJUDICE THE RIGHTS GRANTED BY APPLICABLE CONSUMER LAW, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE REMEDIES UNDER STATUTORY WARRANTY LAW AND TO SEEK DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF THE NON-PERFORMANCE BY APPLE OF ANY OF ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.</p><p><b>1. The Plan</b></p><p>This contract (the “Plan”) governs the services provided by Apple under the above plan and includes the terms in this document, your Plan Confirmation (“Plan Confirmation”), and the original sales receipt for your Plan.

If you purchased your Plan from Apple, you may obtain a copy of your Plan Confirmation by going to <a href="http://mysupport.apple.com/products" tabindex="-1">mysupport.apple.com/products</a>.</p><p>Benefits under this Plan are additional to your rights under applicable laws, the manufacturer's hardware warranty and any complimentary technical support. The terms of the Plan apply the same whether paid for on a one-time basis (“Single-Pay Plan”) or a monthly basis (“Monthly Pay Plan”) unless otherwise noted.</p><p>The Plan covers the following equipment (collectively, the “Covered Equipment”): (i) Mac listed on your Plan Confirmation (“Covered Device”), (ii) the Apple-branded accessories contained inside the original packaging of your Covered Device, and (iii) an Apple-branded mouse, Magic Trackpad, and keyboard if included with the Covered Device (or purchased with a Mac mini, Mac Pro or Mac Studio), an Apple memory modules (RAM) and Apple USB SuperDrive (“Mac Accessories”), which are used with a Covered Device and purchased no earlier than two years before the Covered Device.</p><p>Coverage begins when you purchase the Plan and continues, unless cancelled, through the date specified in your Plan Confirmation (the “Plan Term”).</p><p>You can find the price of the Plan on the original sales receipt.</p><p><b>2. What is Covered?</b></p><p><u>2.1 Hardware Services for Defects or Consumed Battery (“Hardware Service”)</u></p><p>If during the Plan Term, you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that a defect in materials and workmanship has arisen in the Covered Equipment or, in relation to Covered Equipment which uses an integrated rechargeable battery, where the capacity of the Covered Device’s battery to hold an electrical charge is less than eighty percent (80%) of its original specifications, Apple will either: (i) repair the defect at no charge, using new parts or previously used genuine Apple parts that have been tested and pass Apple functional requirements, or (ii) exchange the Covered Equipment with a replacement product that is new or comprised of new and/or previously used genuine Apple parts and has been tested and passed Apple functional requirements.</p><p>All replacement products provided under this Plan will at a minimum have the same or substantially similar features (e.g., a different model with the same features, or the same model in a different color) as the original product. If Apple exchanges the Covered Equipment, the original product becomes Apple’s property and the replacement product is your property, with coverage effective for the remainder of the Plan Term.</p><p><u>2.2 Services for Accidental Damage from Handling (“ADH Service”)</u></p><p>If during the Plan Term you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that the Covered Device has failed due to accidental damage from handling resulting from an unexpected and unintentional external event (such as, drops and damage caused by liquid contact) (“ADH”), Apple will either (i) repair the defect using new parts or previously used genuine Apple parts that have been tested and pass Apple functional requirements, or (ii) exchange the Covered Device with a replacement product that is new or comprised of new and/or previously used genuine Apple parts and has been tested and passed Apple functional requirements. Each time you receive services for ADH is a “Service Event”. <b>Exclusions apply as described below. Each Covered Device is eligible for up to two (2) Service Events every twelve (12) -month period from the date of your Plan purchase as specified on the original sales receipt. Any unused Service Events will expire and you will get two (2) new ADH Service Events to use within the next twelve (12) month period of continued coverage. All other Plan benefits continue throughout.</b></p><p><u>2.3 Technical Support</u></p><p>During the Plan Term, Apple will provide you with priority access to telephone and web-based technical support for Covered Equipment (“Technical Support”). Your Technical Support starts on expiration of the complimentary technical support provided by Apple, which starts on the date you purchase the Covered Equipment. Technical support may include assistance with installation, launch, configuration, troubleshooting, and recovery (excluding data recovery), including storing, retrieving, and managing files; interpreting system error messages; and determining when hardware service is required or ADH coverage may be applicable. Apple will provide support for the then-current version of the supported software, and the prior Major Release. For purposes of this section, the term “Major Release” means a significant version of software that is commercially released by Apple in a release number format such as ”1.0” or “2.0” and which is not in beta or pre-release form.</p><p>Apple Technical Support is limited to the following: (i) the Covered Equipment, (ii) the Apple-branded Operating System (“OS”) and Apple-branded software applications that are pre-installed on or designed to operate with the Covered Equipment (“Consumer Software”), and (iii) connectivity issues between the Covered Equipment and a laptop or desktop computer that meets the Covered Equipment’s connectivity specifications and runs an operating system supported by the Covered Equipment. <b>Exclusions apply as described below.</b></p><p><b>3. What is not Covered?</b></p><p><b><u>3.1 Hardware Services and ADH Services</u></b></p><p><b>Apple may restrict Hardware Service and ADH Services to the country where the Covered Equipment was originally purchased. </b></p><p><b>Apple will not provide Hardware Services or ADH Services in the following circumstances:</b></p><p><b>(a) To protect against normal wear and tear, or to repair cosmetic damage not affecting the functionality of the Covered Equipment;</b></p><p><b>(b) To conduct preventative maintenance;</b></p><p><b>(c) To replace Covered Equipment that is lost or stolen;</b></p><p><b>(d) To repair damage caused by reckless, abusive, willful or intentional conduct, or any use of the Covered Equipment in a manner not normal or intended by Apple;</b></p><p><b>(e) To install, remove or dispose of the Covered Equipment or the equipment provided to you while the Covered Equipment is being serviced;</b></p><p><b>(f) To repair damage caused by a product that is not Covered Equipment;</b></p><p><b>(g) To repair any damage to Covered Equipment (regardless of the cause) if the Covered Equipment has been opened, serviced (including for upgrades and expansions), modified, or altered by anyone other than Apple or an authorized representative of Apple;</b></p><p><b>(h) To repair pre-existing conditions of the Covered Equipment if you purchased the Plan after you purchased the Covered Equipment;</b></p><p><b>(i) To repair any damage to Covered Equipment with a serial number that has been altered, defaced or removed; </b></p><p><b>(j) To repair damages caused by fire, earthquake or other external causes;</b></p><p><b>(k) If your Covered Device is a Mac, to protect against excessive or catastrophic physical damage to Covered Equipment (e.g., products that have been crushed or bent) or excessive or catastrophic damage to Covered Equipment caused by liquid contact (e.g., products that have been partially or wholly submerged in liquid);</b></p><p><b>(l) If your Covered Device is a Mac, to protect against damage caused by the presence of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, biological materials and allergens, that present a risk to human health;</b></p><p><b>(m) The loss of, loss of use of, damage to, corruption of, inability to access, or inability to manipulate any electronic hardware or software, or components thereof, that are used to store, process, access, transmit, or receive information within&nbsp;Covered Equipment as a result of any&nbsp;cause&nbsp;or loss other than covered losses&nbsp;specifically stated in this Plan,&nbsp;including any unauthorized access or unauthorized use of such system, a denial of service attack, or receipt or transmission of malicious code; or </b></p><p><b>(n) The loss of, loss of use of, damage to, corruption of, inability to access, or inability to manipulate any electronic data stored within&nbsp;Covered Equipment, including any such loss caused by unauthorized access or unauthorized use of such data, a denial of service attack, or receipt or transmission of malicious code. </b></p><p><b>Installation of third-party parts may affect your coverage.

How to Obtain Service and Support?</b></p><p>You may obtain service or Technical Support by calling Apple or accessing <a href="https://support.apple.com/" tabindex="-1">support.apple.com</a>. You must provide the Plan Agreement Number or Covered Device serial number. You must also, upon request, present your Plan Confirmation, and the original sales receipt for your Covered Device and your Plan.</p><p><b>5. Service Options</b></p><p>Apple will provide hardware services to you through one or more of these options:</p><p>(a) Carry-in service. Carry-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. Return the Covered Equipment to an Apple-owned retail store location or to an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”) that offers carry-in service. Service will be performed for you at the store, or the store may send the Covered Equipment to an Apple repair service (“ARS”) site for service. You must promptly retrieve the Covered Equipment.</p><p>(b) Onsite service. Onsite service is available for many Mac desktop computers if the location of the Covered Equipment is within 50 miles (80 kilometers) radius of an Apple Authorized Onsite Service Provider. Certain parts serviceable under do-it-yourself parts service, as described below, are not eligible for Onsite service. If Apple determines that onsite service is available, Apple will dispatch a service technician to the location of the Covered Equipment. Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(c) Onsite service is available for certain other Covered Devices, depending on availability in your service location. Verify eligibility and schedule a service appointment with an Apple authorized mobile service provider at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/country-selector" tabindex="-1">support.apple.com/country-selector</a>. If onsite service is available at your desired location, you will be contacted directly by Apple’s authorized service provider to confirm your appointment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will&nbsp;transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple&nbsp;will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(d) Mail-in service. Direct mail-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. If Apple determines that your Covered Equipment is eligible for mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills (and, if needed, packaging material). You must ship the Covered Equipment to an ARS site in accordance with Apple’s instructions. Once service is complete, the ARS site will return the Covered Equipment to you. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if you follow all instructions.</p><p>(e) Express Replacement Service (“ERS”) or do-it-yourself (“DIY”) parts service. ERS is available for certain Covered Equipment. ERS is not available for Mac. DIY parts service is available for many Covered Equipment. This allows you to service your own Covered Equipment. If Apple requires return of the replaced device or part, Apple may require a credit card authorization to serve as security for the retail price of the replacement device or part and applicable shipping costs until you return the replaced device as instructed. If you are not able to provide credit card authorization, service may not be available to you in which case Apple will offer an alternative arrangement for service. If you fail to return the replaced Covered Equipment or part as instructed or return a replaced Covered Equipment or part that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge the credit card for the authorized amount. If Apple does not require return of the replaced product or part, Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement product or part accompanied by any applicable instructions or requirements for disposal of the replaced product or part. Apple is not responsible for any labor costs you incur in respect to ERS or DIY parts service.</p><p>Apple may change the method by which Apple provides repair or replacement service to you, and your Covered Equipment's eligibility to receive a particular method of service.</p><p>Service will be limited to the options available in the country where you request service. Service options, parts availability and response times may vary. If service is not available for the Covered Equipment in a country that is not the country of purchase, you may be responsible for shipping and handling charges to facilitate service in a country where service is available. If you seek service in a country that is not the country of purchase, you must comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. For international service, Apple may repair or exchange products and parts with comparable products and parts that comply with local standards.</p><p><b>6. Your Responsibilities</b></p><p>To receive service or support under the Plan, you agree to (i) provide your Plan Agreement Number and a copy of your Plan’s original proof of purchase, (ii) provide information about the symptoms and causes of the issues with the Covered Equipment, (iii) respond to requests for information needed to diagnose or service the Covered Equipment, (iv) follow instructions Apple gives you, (v) update software to currently published releases prior to seeking service, and (vi) back up software and data residing on the Covered Equipment.</p><p>DURING HARDWARE SERVICE, APPLE WILL DELETE THE CONTENTS OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT AND REFORMAT THE STORAGE MEDIA. Apple will return your Covered Equipment or provide a replacement as the Covered Equipment was originally configured, subject to applicable updates. Apple may install OS updates as part of hardware service that will prevent the Covered Equipment from reverting to an earlier version of the OS. Third-party applications installed on the Covered Equipment may not be compatible or work with the Covered Equipment as a result of the OS update. You will be responsible for reinstalling all other software programs, data, and passwords.</p><p><b>7. Limitation of Liability</b></p><p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNER OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE COSTS OF RECOVERING, REPROGRAMMING, OR REPRODUCING ANY PROGRAM OR DATA OR THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA, ANY LOSS OF BUSINESS, PROFITS, REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, RESULTING FROM APPLE’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PLAN. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIMIT OF APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES’ AND AGENTS’ LIABILITY TO YOU AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNER ARISING UNDER THE PLAN SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID FOR THE PLAN. APPLE SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT (i) IT WILL BE ABLE TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE COVERED EQUIPMENT WITHOUT RISK TO OR LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, (ii) IT WILL MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA, OR (iii) THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.</p><p>THE BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THIS PLAN ARE IN ADDITION TO ANY RIGHTS AND REMEDIES PROVIDED UNDER CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY UNDER SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE LIMITED, APPLE’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED, AT ITS SOLE OPTION, TO REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT OR SUPPLY OF THE SERVICE. SOME STATES OR PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p><b>8.

If local law permits and Apple cancels this Plan for the unavailability of service parts, you will receive a pro-rata refund for the Plan’s unexpired term.</p><p><u>8.2 Monthly Pay Plans</u></p><p>You may cancel this Plan at any time for any reason. If you purchased a Monthly Pay Plan from any seller other than Apple directly (a “Reseller”), contact the Reseller to cancel your Plan. If you purchased a Monthly Pay Plan from Apple, you may cancel by notifying Apple with your Plan Agreement Number and original proof of purchase as noted in Section 8.1 above. Unless applicable local law provides otherwise, if you return your Covered Device within the eligible fourteen (14)-day return window, you are entitled to cancel your Plan and receive a full refund of the first monthly payment you have made. To cancel, you must call Apple as instructed above. If you otherwise cancel your Plan, not in connection with return of your Covered Device, cancellation will be deferred until midnight on the last day of the month for which the last monthly payment was paid. Your failure to timely and fully make any monthly payment will be deemed an expression of your intent to cancel your Plan and you will not be entitled to receive a refund of any monthly payments you have made. If your Monthly Pay Plan was financed by a third party, Apple may return any refund owed to that financing entity.</p><p><u>8.3 Effect of Cancellation</u></p><p>Upon the effective date of your early cancellation, Apple’s future obligations under this Plan to you are fully extinguished.</p><p><b>9.

</p>
<p>THE BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THIS PLAN ARE IN ADDITION TO ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES PROVIDED UNDER CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THIS PLAN SHALL NOT PREJUDICE THE RIGHTS GRANTED BY APPLICABLE CONSUMER LAW, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE REMEDIES UNDER STATUTORY WARRANTY LAW AND TO SEEK DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF THE NON-PERFORMANCE BY APPLE OF ANY OF ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.</p>
<p><b>1. The Plan</b></p>
<p>This contract (the “Plan”) governs the services provided by Apple under the above plan and includes the terms in this document, your Plan Confirmation (“Plan Confirmation”), and the original sales receipt for your Plan. Your Plan Confirmation will be provided to you at the time of purchase or sent to you automatically thereafter. If you purchased your Plan from Apple, you may obtain a copy of your Plan Confirmation by going to&nbsp;<a href="http://mysupport.apple.com/products" tabindex="-1">mysupport.apple.com/products</a>.</p>
<p>Benefits under this Plan are additional to your rights under applicable laws, the manufacturer's hardware warranty and any complimentary technical support. The terms of the Plan apply the same whether paid for on a one-time basis (“Single-Pay Plan”) or a monthly basis (“Monthly Pay Plan”) unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p>The Plan covers the following equipment (collectively, the “Covered Equipment”): (i) Mac listed on your Plan Confirmation (“Covered Device”), (ii) the Apple-branded accessories contained inside the original packaging of your Covered Device, and (iii) an&nbsp;Apple-branded mouse, Magic Trackpad, and keyboard if included with the Covered Device (or purchased with a Mac mini, Mac Pro, or Mac Studio), an&nbsp;Apple memory modules (RAM) and Apple USB SuperDrive (“Mac Accessories”), which are used with a Covered Device and purchased no earlier than two years before the Covered Device.</p>
<p>Coverage begins when you purchase the Plan and continues, unless cancelled, through the date specified in your Plan Confirmation (the “Plan Term”).</p>
<p>You can find the price of the Plan on the original sales receipt.</p>
<p><b>2. What is Covered?</b></p>
<p><u>2.1 Hardware Services for Defects or Consumed Battery (“Hardware Service”)</u></p>
<p>If during the Plan Term, you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that a defect in materials and workmanship has arisen in the Covered Equipment or, in relation to Covered Equipment which uses an integrated rechargeable battery, where the capacity of the Covered Device’s battery to hold an electrical charge is less than eighty percent (80%) of its original specifications, Apple will either: (i) repair the defect at no charge, using new parts or reclaimed Apple genuine parts that have been tested and pass Apple functional requirements, or (ii) exchange the Covered Equipment with a replacement product that is new or comprised of new and/or reclaimed Apple genuine parts and has been tested and passed Apple functional requirements.</p>
<p>All replacement products provided under this Plan will at a minimum have the same or substantially similar features (e.g., a different model with the same features, or the same model in a different color) as the original product. If Apple exchanges the Covered Equipment, the original product becomes Apple’s property and the replacement product is your property, with coverage effective for the remainder of the Plan Term.</p>
<p><u>2.2 Services for Accidental Damage from Handling (“ADH Service”)</u></p>
<p>If during the Plan Term you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that the Covered Device has failed due to accidental damage from handling resulting from an unexpected and unintentional external event (such as, drops and damage caused by liquid contact) (“ADH”), Apple will either (i) repair the defect using new parts or reclaimed Apple genuine parts that have been tested and pass Apple functional requirements, or (ii) exchange the Covered Device with a replacement product that is new or comprised of new and/or reclaimed Apple genuine parts and has been tested and passed Apple functional requirements. Each time you receive services for ADH is a&nbsp;“Service Event”.&nbsp;<b>Exclusions apply as described below. Each Covered Device is eligible for up to two (2) Service Events every twelve (12) -month period from the date of your Plan purchase as specified on the original sales receipt. Any unused Service Events will expire and you will get two (2) new ADH Service Events to use within the next&nbsp;twelve (12) month period of continued coverage.&nbsp;All other Plan benefits continue throughout.</b></p>
<p><u>2.3 Technical Support</u></p>
<p>During the Plan Term, Apple will provide you with priority access to telephone and web-based technical support for Covered Equipment (“Technical Support”). Your Technical Support starts on expiration of the complimentary technical support provided by Apple, which starts on the date you purchase the Covered Equipment. Technical support may include assistance with installation, launch, configuration, troubleshooting, and recovery (excluding data recovery), including storing, retrieving, and managing files; interpreting system error messages; and determining when hardware service is required or ADH coverage may be applicable. Apple will provide support for the then-current version of the supported software, and the prior Major Release. For purposes of this section, the term “Major Release” means a significant version of software that is commercially released by Apple in a release number format such as ”1.0” or “2.0” and which is not in beta or pre-release form.</p>
<p>Apple Technical Support is limited to the following: (i) the Covered Equipment, (ii) the Apple-branded Operating System (“OS”) and Apple-branded software applications that are pre-installed on or designed to operate with the Covered Equipment (“Consumer Software”), and (iii) connectivity issues between the Covered Equipment and a laptop or desktop computer that meets the Covered Equipment’s connectivity specifications and runs an operating system supported by the Covered Equipment.&nbsp;<b>Exclusions apply as described below.</b></p>

<p>Installation of third-party parts may affect your coverage. As a condition of receiving Hardware or ADH Services, all Covered Equipment must be returned to Apple in its entirety including all original parts or Apple-authorized replacement components. The restriction does not prejudice your consumer law rights.</p>

<p><b>4. How to Obtain Service and Support?</b></p>

You must also, upon request, present your Plan Confirmation, and the original sales receipt for your Covered Device and your Plan.</p>
<p><b>5. Service Options</b></p>
<p>Apple will provide hardware services to you through one or more of these options:</p>
<p>(a) Carry-in service. Carry-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. Return the Covered Equipment to an Apple-owned retail store location or to an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”) that offers carry-in service. Service will be performed for you at the store, or the store may send the Covered Equipment to an Apple repair service (“ARS”) site for service. You must promptly retrieve the Covered Equipment.</p>
<p>(b) Onsite service. Onsite service is available for many Mac desktop computers if the location of the Covered Equipment is within 50 miles (80 kilometers) radius of an Apple Authorized Onsite Service Provider. Certain parts serviceable under do-it-yourself parts service, as described below, are not eligible for Onsite service. If Apple determines that onsite service is available, Apple will dispatch a service technician to the location of the Covered Equipment. Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;Onsite service is available for certain other Covered Devices, depending on availability in your service location. Verify eligibility and schedule a service appointment with an Apple authorized mobile service provider at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/country-selector" tabindex="-1">support.apple.com/country-selector</a>. If onsite service is available at your desired location, you will be contacted directly by Apple’s authorized service provider to confirm your appointment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will&nbsp;transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple&nbsp;will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service.&nbsp;If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p>
<p>(d) Mail-in service. Direct mail-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. If Apple determines that your Covered Equipment is eligible for mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills (and, if needed, packaging material). You must ship the Covered Equipment to an ARS site in accordance with Apple’s instructions. Once service is complete, the ARS site will return the Covered Equipment to you. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if you follow all instructions.</p>
<p>(e) Express Replacement Service (“ERS”) or do-it-yourself (“DIY”) parts service. ERS is available for certain Covered Equipment.&nbsp;ERS is not available for Mac.&nbsp;DIY parts service is available for many Covered Equipment. This allows you to service your own Covered Equipment. If Apple requires return of the replaced device or part, Apple may require a credit card authorization to serve as security for the retail price of the replacement device or part and applicable shipping costs until you return the replaced device as instructed. If you are not able to provide credit card authorization, service may not be available to you in which case Apple will offer an alternative arrangement for service. If you fail to return the replaced Covered Equipment or part as instructed or return a replaced Covered Equipment or part that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge the credit card for the authorized amount. If Apple does not require return of the replaced product or part, Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement product or part accompanied by any applicable instructions or requirements for disposal of the replaced product or part. Apple is not responsible for any labor costs you incur in respect to ERS or DIY parts service.</p>
<p>Apple may change the method by which Apple provides repair or replacement service to you, and your Covered Equipment's eligibility to receive a particular method of service.</p>
<p>Service will be limited to the options available in the country where you request service. Service options, parts availability and response times may vary. If service is not available for the Covered Equipment in a country that is not the country of purchase, you may be responsible for shipping and handling charges to facilitate service in a country where service is available. If you seek service in a country that is not the country of purchase, you must comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. For international service, Apple may repair or exchange products and parts with comparable products and parts that comply with local standards.</p>
<p><b>6. Your Responsibilities</b></p>
<p>To receive service or support under the Plan, you agree to (i) provide your Plan Agreement Number and a copy of your Plan’s original proof of purchase, (ii) provide information about the symptoms and causes of the issues with the Covered Equipment, (iii) respond to requests for information needed to diagnose or service the Covered Equipment, (iv) follow instructions Apple gives you, (v) update software to currently published releases prior to seeking service, and (vi) back up software and data residing on the Covered Equipment.</p>
<p>DURING HARDWARE SERVICE, APPLE WILL DELETE THE CONTENTS OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT AND REFORMAT THE STORAGE MEDIA. Apple will return your Covered Equipment or provide a replacement as the Covered Equipment was originally configured, subject to applicable updates. Apple may install OS updates as part of hardware service that will prevent the Covered Equipment from reverting to an earlier version of the OS. Third-party applications installed on the Covered Equipment may not be compatible or work with the Covered Equipment as a result of the OS update. You will be responsible for reinstalling all other software programs, data, and passwords.</p>

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIMIT OF APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES’ AND AGENTS’ LIABILITY TO YOU AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNER ARISING UNDER THE PLAN SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID FOR THE PLAN. APPLE SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT (i) IT WILL BE ABLE TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE COVERED EQUIPMENT WITHOUT RISK TO OR LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, (ii) IT WILL MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA, OR (iii) THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.</p>
<p>THE BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THIS PLAN ARE IN ADDITION TO ANY RIGHTS AND REMEDIES PROVIDED UNDER CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY UNDER SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE LIMITED, APPLE’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED, AT ITS SOLE OPTION, TO REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT OR SUPPLY OF THE SERVICE.

How to Obtain Service and Support?</b></p><p>You may obtain service or Technical Support by calling Apple or accessing <a href="http://support.apple.com/country-selector" tabindex="-1">support.apple.com/country-selector</a>. You must provide the Plan Agreement Number or Covered Device serial number. You must also, upon request, present your Plan Confirmation, and the original sales receipt for your Covered Device and your Plan.</p><p><b>5. Service Options</b></p><p>Apple will provide hardware services to you through one or more of these options:</p><p>(a) Carry-in service. Carry-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. Return the Covered Equipment to an Apple-owned retail store location or to an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”) that offers carry-in service. Service will be performed for you at the store, or the store may send the Covered Equipment to an Apple repair service (“ARS”) site for service. You must promptly retrieve the Covered Equipment.</p><p>(b) Onsite service. Onsite service is available for many Mac desktop computers if the location of the Covered Equipment is within 50 miles (80 kilometers) radius of an Apple Authorized Onsite Service Provider. Certain parts serviceable under do-it-yourself parts service, as described below, are not eligible for Onsite service. If Apple determines that onsite service is available, Apple will dispatch a service technician to the location of the Covered Equipment. Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(c) Onsite service is available for certain other Covered Devices, depending on availability in your service location. Verify eligibility and schedule a service appointment with an Apple authorized mobile service provider at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/country-selector" tabindex="-1">support.apple.com/country-selector</a>. If onsite service is available at your desired location, you will be contacted directly by Apple’s authorized service provider to confirm your appointment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will&nbsp;transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple&nbsp;will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(d) Mail-in service. Direct mail-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. If Apple determines that your Covered Equipment is eligible for mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills (and, if needed, packaging material). You must ship the Covered Equipment to an ARS site in accordance with Apple’s instructions. Once service is complete, the ARS site will return the Covered Equipment to you. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if you follow all instructions.</p><p>(e) Express Replacement Service (“ERS”) or do-it-yourself (“DIY”) parts service. ERS is available for certain Covered Equipment. ERS is not available for Mac. DIY parts service is available for many Covered Equipment. This allows you to service your own Covered Equipment. If Apple requires return of the replaced device or part, Apple may require a credit card authorization to serve as security for the retail price of the replacement device or part and applicable shipping costs until you return the replaced device as instructed. If you are not able to provide credit card authorization, service may not be available to you in which case Apple will offer an alternative arrangement for service. If you fail to return the replaced Covered Equipment or part as instructed or return a replaced Covered Equipment or part that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge the credit card for the authorized amount. If Apple does not require return of the replaced product or part, Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement product or part accompanied by any applicable instructions or requirements for disposal of the replaced product or part. Apple is not responsible for any labor costs you incur in respect to ERS or DIY parts service.</p><p>Apple may change the method by which Apple provides repair or replacement service to you, and your Covered Equipment's eligibility to receive a particular method of service.</p><p>Service will be limited to the options available in the country where you request service. Service options, parts availability and response times may vary. If service is not available for the Covered Equipment in a country that is not the country of purchase, you may be responsible for shipping and handling charges to facilitate service in a country where service is available. If you seek service in a country that is not the country of purchase, you must comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. For international service, Apple may repair or exchange products and parts with comparable products and parts that comply with local standards.</p><p><b>6.

Apple will return your Covered Equipment or provide a replacement as the Covered Equipment was originally configured, subject to applicable updates. Apple may install OS updates as part of hardware service that will prevent the Covered Equipment from reverting to an earlier version of the OS. Third-party applications installed on the Covered Equipment may not be compatible or work with the Covered Equipment as a result of the OS update. You will be responsible for reinstalling all other software programs, data, and passwords.</p><p><b>7. Limitation of Liability</b></p><p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNER OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE COSTS OF RECOVERING, REPROGRAMMING, OR REPRODUCING ANY PROGRAM OR DATA OR THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA, ANY LOSS OF BUSINESS, PROFITS, REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, RESULTING FROM APPLE’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PLAN. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIMIT OF APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES’ AND AGENTS’ LIABILITY TO YOU AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNER ARISING UNDER THE PLAN SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID FOR THE PLAN. APPLE SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT (i) IT WILL BE ABLE TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE COVERED EQUIPMENT WITHOUT RISK TO OR LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, (ii) IT WILL MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA, OR (iii) THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.</p><p>THE BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THIS PLAN ARE IN ADDITION TO ANY RIGHTS AND REMEDIES PROVIDED UNDER CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY UNDER SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE LIMITED, APPLE’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED, AT ITS SOLE OPTION, TO REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT OR SUPPLY OF THE SERVICE. SOME STATES OR PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p><b>8.

If you otherwise cancel your Plan, not in connection with return of your Covered Device, cancellation will be deferred until midnight on the last day of the month for which the last monthly payment was paid.

THIS PLAN SHALL NOT PREJUDICE THE RIGHTS GRANTED BY APPLICABLE CONSUMER LAW, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE REMEDIES UNDER STATUTORY WARRANTY LAW AND TO SEEK DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF THE NON-PERFORMANCE BY APPLE OF ANY OF ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.</p><p><b>1. The Plan</b></p><p>This contract (the “Plan”) governs the services provided by Apple under the above plan and includes the terms in this document, your Plan Confirmation (“Plan Confirmation”), and the original sales receipt for your Plan. Your Plan Confirmation will be provided to you at the time of purchase or sent to you automatically thereafter. If you purchased your Plan from Apple, you may obtain a copy of your Plan Confirmation by going to <a href="http://mysupport.apple.com/products" tabindex="-1">mysupport.apple.com/products</a>.</p><p>Benefits under this Plan are additional to your rights under applicable laws, the manufacturer's hardware warranty and any complimentary technical support. The terms of the Plan apply the same whether paid for on a one-time basis (“Single-Pay Plan”) or a monthly basis (“Monthly Pay Plan”) unless otherwise noted.</p><p>The Plan covers the following equipment (collectively, the “Covered Equipment”): (i) Mac listed on your Plan Confirmation (“Covered Device”), (ii) the Apple-branded accessories contained inside the original packaging of your Covered Device, and (iii) an Apple-branded mouse, Magic Trackpad, and keyboard if included with the Covered Device (or purchased with a Mac mini or Mac Pro), an Apple memory modules (RAM) and Apple USB SuperDrive (“Mac Accessories”), which are used with a Covered Device and purchased no earlier than two years before the Covered Device.</p><p>Coverage begins when you purchase the Plan and continues, unless cancelled, through the date specified in your Plan Confirmation (the “Plan Term”).</p><p>You can find the price of the Plan on the original sales receipt.</p><p><b>2. What is Covered?</b></p><p><u>2.1 Hardware Services for Defects or Consumed Battery (“Hardware Service”)</u></p><p>If during the Plan Term, you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that a defect in materials and workmanship has arisen in the Covered Equipment or, in relation to Covered Equipment which uses an integrated rechargeable battery, where the capacity of the Covered Device’s battery to hold an electrical charge is less than eighty percent (80%) of its original specifications, Apple will either: (i) repair the defect at no charge, using new parts or parts that are equivalent to new in performance and reliability, or (ii) exchange the Covered Equipment with a replacement product that is new or equivalent to new in performance and reliability.</p><p>All replacement products provided under this Plan will at a minimum be functionally equivalent to the original product. If Apple exchanges the Covered Equipment, the original product becomes Apple’s property and the replacement product is your property, with coverage effective for the remainder of the Plan Term.</p><p><u>2.2 Services for Accidental Damage from Handling (“ADH Service”)</u></p><p>If during the Plan Term you submit a valid claim by notifying Apple that the Covered Device has failed due to accidental damage from handling resulting from an unexpected and unintentional external event (such as, drops and damage caused by liquid contact) (“ADH”), Apple will either (i) repair the defect using new or refurbished parts that are equivalent to new in performance and reliability, or (ii) exchange the Covered Device with a replacement product that is new or equivalent to new in performance and reliability. Each time you receive services for ADH is a “Service Event”. <b>Exclusions apply as described below. Each Covered Device is eligible for up to two (2) Service Events every twelve (12) -month period from the date of your Plan purchase as specified on the original sales receipt. Any unused Service Events will expire and you will get two (2) new ADH Service Events to use within the next twelve (12) month period of continued coverage. All other Plan benefits continue throughout.</b></p><p><u>2.3 Technical Support</u></p><p>During the Plan Term, Apple will provide you with priority access to telephone and web-based technical support for Covered Equipment (“Technical Support”). Your Technical Support starts on expiration of the complimentary technical support provided by Apple, which starts on the date you purchase the Covered Equipment. Technical support may include assistance with installation, launch, configuration, troubleshooting, and recovery (excluding data recovery), including storing, retrieving, and managing files; interpreting system error messages; and determining when hardware service is required or ADH coverage may be applicable. Apple will provide support for the then-current version of the supported software, and the prior Major Release. For purposes of this section, the term “Major Release” means a significant version of software that is commercially released by Apple in a release number format such as ”1.0” or “2.0” and which is not in beta or pre-release form.</p><p>Apple Technical Support is limited to the following: (i) the Covered Equipment, (ii) the Apple-branded Operating System (“OS”) and Apple-branded software applications that are pre-installed on or designed to operate with the Covered Equipment (“Consumer Software”), and (iii) connectivity issues between the Covered Equipment and a laptop or desktop computer that meets the Covered Equipment’s connectivity specifications and runs an operating system supported by the Covered Equipment. <b>Exclusions apply as described below.</b></p><p><b>3. What is not Covered?</b></p><p><u>3.1 Hardware Services and ADH Services</u></p><p>Apple may restrict Hardware Service and ADH Services to the country where the Covered Equipment was originally purchased. </p><p>Apple will not provide Hardware Services or ADH Services in the following circumstances:</p><p>(a) to protect against normal wear and tear, or to repair cosmetic damage not affecting the functionality of the Covered Equipment;</p><p>(b) to conduct preventative maintenance;</p><p>(c) to replace Covered Equipment that is lost or stolen;</p><p>(d) to repair damage caused by reckless, abusive, willful or intentional conduct, or any use of the Covered Equipment in a manner not normal or intended by Apple;</p><p>(e) to install, remove or dispose of the Covered Equipment or the equipment provided to you while the Covered Equipment is being serviced;</p><p>(f) to repair damage caused by a product that is not Covered Equipment;</p><p>(g) to repair any damage to Covered Equipment (regardless of the cause) if the Covered Equipment has been opened, serviced (including for upgrades and expansions), modified, or altered by anyone other than Apple or an authorized representative of Apple;</p><p>(h) to repair pre-existing conditions of the Covered Equipment if you purchased the Plan after you purchased the Covered Equipment;</p><p>(i) to repair any damage to Covered Equipment with a serial number that has been altered, defaced or removed; </p><p>(j) to repair damages caused by fire, earthquake or other external causes;</p><p>(k) If your Covered Device is a Mac, to protect against excessive or catastrophic physical damage to Covered Equipment (e.g., products that have been crushed or bent) or excessive or catastrophic damage to Covered Equipment caused by liquid contact (e.g., products that have been partially or wholly submerged in liquid); or</p><p>(l) If your Covered Device is a Mac, to protect against damage caused by the presence of hazardous materials, including, but not limited to, biological materials and allergens, that present a risk to human health.</p><p>Installation of third-party parts may affect your coverage. As a condition of receiving Hardware or ADH Services, all Covered Equipment must be returned to Apple in its entirety including all original parts or Apple-authorized replacement components. The restriction does not prejudice your consumer law rights.</p><p><u>3.2 Technical Support</u></p><p>Apple will not provide Technical Support in the following circumstances:</p><p>(a) For use of the OS and Consumer Software as server-based applications;</p><p>(b) For issues that could be resolved by upgrading software to the then-current version;</p><p>(c) For third-party products or their effects on or interactions with the Covered Equipment;</p><p>(d) For your use of a computer or OS that is not related to Consumer Software or to connectivity issues with the Covered Equipment;</p><p>(e) For software other than the Consumer Software;</p><p>(f) For any Consumer Software designated as “beta”, “prerelease”, or “preview”, or similar designation; or</p><p>(g) For damage to, or loss of, any software or data that was residing or recorded on the Covered Equipment (note: the Plan does not cover the recovery or reinstallation of software programs and user data).</p><p><b>4. How to Obtain Service and Support?</b></p><p>You may obtain service or Technical Support by calling Apple or accessing <a href="http://support.apple.com/country-selector" tabindex="-1">support.apple.com/country-selector</a>. You must provide the Plan Agreement Number or Covered Device serial number. You must also, upon request, present your Plan Confirmation, and the original sales receipt for your Covered Device and your Plan.</p><p><b>5. Service Options</b></p><p>Apple will provide hardware services to you through one or more of these options:</p><p>(a) Carry-in service. Carry-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. Return the Covered Equipment to an Apple-owned retail store location or to an Apple Authorized Service Provider (“AASP”) that offers carry-in service. Service will be performed for you at the store, or the store may send the Covered Equipment to an Apple repair service (“ARS”) site for service. You must promptly retrieve the Covered Equipment.</p><p>(b) Onsite service. Onsite service is available for many Mac desktop computers if the location of the Covered Equipment is within 50 miles (80 kilometers) radius of an Apple Authorized Onsite Service Provider. Certain parts serviceable under do-it-yourself parts service, as described below, are not eligible for Onsite service. If Apple determines that onsite service is available, Apple will dispatch a service technician to the location of the Covered Equipment. Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(c) Onsite service is available for certain other Covered Devices, depending on availability in your service location. Verify eligibility and schedule a service appointment with an Apple authorized mobile service provider at&nbsp;<a href="http://support.apple.com/country-selector" tabindex="-1">support.apple.com/country-selector</a>. If onsite service is available at your desired location, you will be contacted directly by Apple’s authorized service provider to confirm your appointment. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Service will be performed at the location, or the service technician will&nbsp;transport the Covered Equipment to an AASP or ARS location for repair. If the Covered Equipment is repaired at an AASP or ARS location, Apple&nbsp;will arrange for transportation of the Covered Equipment to your location following service. If the service technician is not granted access to the Covered Equipment at the appointed time, any further onsite visits may be subject to an additional charge.</p><p>(d) Mail-in service. Direct mail-in service is available for most Covered Equipment. If Apple determines that your Covered Equipment is eligible for mail-in service, Apple will send you prepaid waybills (and, if needed, packaging material). You must ship the Covered Equipment to an ARS site in accordance with Apple’s instructions. Once service is complete, the ARS site will return the Covered Equipment to you. Apple will pay for shipping to and from your location if you follow all instructions.</p><p>(e) Express Replacement Service (“ERS”) or do-it-yourself (“DIY”) parts service. ERS is available for certain Covered Equipment. ERS is not available for Mac. DIY parts service is available for many Covered Equipment. This allows you to service your own Covered Equipment. If Apple requires return of the replaced device or part, Apple may require a credit card authorization to serve as security for the retail price of the replacement device or part and applicable shipping costs until you return the replaced device as instructed. If you are not able to provide credit card authorization, service may not be available to you in which case Apple will offer an alternative arrangement for service. If you fail to return the replaced Covered Equipment or part as instructed or return a replaced Covered Equipment or part that is ineligible for service, Apple will charge the credit card for the authorized amount. If Apple does not require return of the replaced product or part, Apple will ship you free of charge a replacement product or part accompanied by any applicable instructions or requirements for disposal of the replaced product or part. Apple is not responsible for any labor costs you incur in respect to ERS or DIY parts service.</p><p>Apple may change the method by which Apple provides repair or replacement service to you, and your Covered Equipment's eligibility to receive a particular method of service.</p><p>Service will be limited to the options available in the country where you request service. Service options, parts availability and response times may vary. If service is not available for the Covered Equipment in a country that is not the country of purchase, you may be responsible for shipping and handling charges to facilitate service in a country where service is available. If you seek service in a country that is not the country of purchase, you must comply with all applicable import and export laws and regulations and be responsible for all custom duties, V.A.T. and other associated taxes and charges. For international service, Apple may repair or exchange products and parts with comparable products and parts that comply with local standards.</p><p><b>6. Your Responsibilities</b></p><p>To receive service or support under the Plan, you agree to (i) provide your Plan Agreement Number and a copy of your Plan’s original proof of purchase, (ii) provide information about the symptoms and causes of the issues with the Covered Equipment, (iii) respond to requests for information needed to diagnose or service the Covered Equipment, (iv) follow instructions Apple gives you, (v) update software to currently published releases prior to seeking service, and (vi) back up software and data residing on the Covered Equipment.</p><p>DURING HARDWARE SERVICE, APPLE WILL DELETE THE CONTENTS OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT AND REFORMAT THE STORAGE MEDIA. Apple will return your Covered Equipment or provide a replacement as the Covered Equipment was originally configured, subject to applicable updates. Apple may install OS updates as part of hardware service that will prevent the Covered Equipment from reverting to an earlier version of the OS. Third-party applications installed on the Covered Equipment may not be compatible or work with the Covered Equipment as a result of the OS update. You will be responsible for reinstalling all other software programs, data, and passwords.</p><p><b>7. Limitation of Liability</b></p><p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNER OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE COSTS OF RECOVERING, REPROGRAMMING, OR REPRODUCING ANY PROGRAM OR DATA OR THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA, ANY LOSS OF BUSINESS, PROFITS, REVENUE OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, RESULTING FROM APPLE’S OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS PLAN. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE LIMIT OF APPLE AND ITS EMPLOYEES’ AND AGENTS’ LIABILITY TO YOU AND ANY SUBSEQUENT OWNER ARISING UNDER THE PLAN SHALL NOT EXCEED THE ORIGINAL PRICE PAID FOR THE PLAN. APPLE SPECIFICALLY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT (i) IT WILL BE ABLE TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE COVERED EQUIPMENT WITHOUT RISK TO OR LOSS OF PROGRAMS OR DATA, (ii) IT WILL MAINTAIN THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA, OR (iii) THE OPERATION OF THE PRODUCT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.</p><p>THE BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THIS PLAN ARE IN ADDITION TO ANY RIGHTS AND REMEDIES PROVIDED UNDER CONSUMER LAWS AND REGULATIONS. TO THE EXTENT THAT LIABILITY UNDER SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS MAY BE LIMITED, APPLE’S LIABILITY IS LIMITED, AT ITS SOLE OPTION, TO REPLACEMENT OR REPAIR OF THE COVERED EQUIPMENT OR SUPPLY OF THE SERVICE. SOME STATES OR PROVINCES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p><p><b>8.

If local law permits and Apple cancels this Plan for the unavailability of service parts, you will receive a pro-rata refund for the Plan’s unexpired term.</p><p><u>8.2 Monthly Pay Plans</u></p><p>You may cancel this Plan at any time for any reason. If you purchased a Monthly Pay Plan from any seller other than Apple directly (a “Reseller”), contact the Reseller to cancel your Plan. If you purchased a Monthly Pay Plan from Apple, you may cancel by notifying Apple with your Plan Agreement Number and original proof of purchase as noted in Section 8.1 above.
